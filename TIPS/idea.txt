1. split long logic to small ones step by step, by using simple "for" or "if" functions. 
   With the fixed order, we have the data transfer.
2. small functions could also be setup as subfunction under the solution class.
3. LinkedList:node=node.next;
4. Binary Search:
 Â  mid: GOOD:begin+(end-begin)/2;
        BAD:(begin+end)/2, cause corner case:(begin+end) > Integer.MAX_VALUE;
5. sorted array, double pointer:i=0,j=siz-1;sum<target, i++;sum>target, j--.
6. The statement ++array[s.charAt(i) - 'A']; is incrementing the value in the array indexed by s.charAt(i) - 'A'.
   What this loop does is that it counts up the number of occurrences of each letter in s.
   The reason for - 'A', is that it "shifts" the ascii/unicode value so that A - Z have values 0 - 25. And are thus more          suitable as an array index.
